        <h2>BS Computer Science</h2>

        <p>
          As a 2022 Computer Science graduate from the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, I strive to develop my
          knowledge as a developer.
          Since graduating, I have been taking several online courses to learn languages and skills I didn't learn
          during
          my degree, such as Docker and Kubernetes, HTML, CSS, etc. I'm also working on a personal project to develop
          these new skills further.
          I hope that by learning these new skills, I can help a company reach
          their goals.

          <h3>League of Legends Match History</h3>
          <img src="images/league-logo.png" alt="League of Legends Logo">
          <p>I play a popular game called League of Legends by Riot Games. There are many websites that utilize Riot
            Games
            API to display your match history.</p>
          <p>I have tried to look for a website that allows me to filter my match history in more depth than just the
            champion I'm playing, but I have yet to find one</p>
          <p>So I decided I'm going to make one! This will allow me to filter my match history based on my champion, my
            keystone rune, the items I buy in game, and possibly who I am fighting against in my lane. I say possibly
            because this project is still in the works, but I'm really excited to see what I can make it do!</p>
